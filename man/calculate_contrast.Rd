\title{Calculates contrasts between fully specified survival functions}
\usage{
calculate_contrast(
  scale_trt = NULL,
  shape_trt = 1,
  scale_ctrl = NULL,
  shape_ctrl = 1,
  parameterization = 1,
  output = "RMSTD",
  percentile = NULL,
  t = NULL,
  tau = NULL,
  plot_curves = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scale_trt}{A scalar \eqn{>0} specifying the \dfn{scale parameter} in the treatment group.}

\item{shape_trt}{A scalar \eqn{>0} specifying the \dfn{shape parameter} in the treatment group. Defaults to \code{shape_trt} \eqn{=1}, simplifying to exponential survival.}

\item{scale_ctrl}{A scalar \eqn{>0} specifying the \dfn{scale parameter} in the treatment group.}

\item{shape_ctrl}{A scalar \eqn{>0} specifying the \dfn{shape parameter} in the treatment group. Defaults to \code{shape_ctrl} \eqn{=1}, simplifying to exponential survival.}

\item{parameterization}{One of: \itemize{
\item \code{parameterization = 1}: specifies Weibull distributed survival as \eqn{S(t) = 1- F(t) = \exp{(-(t/\mathrm{scale})^\mathrm{shape}))}},
\item \code{parameterization = 2}: specifies Weibull distributed survival as \eqn{S(t) = 1- F(t) = \exp{(-\mathrm{scale} * t^\mathrm{shape})}},
\item \code{parameterization = 3}: specifies Weibull distributed survival as \eqn{S(t) = 1- F(t) = \exp{(-(\mathrm{scale} * t)^\mathrm{shape})}}.}}

\item{output}{A string specifying whether to calculate the difference in
RMSTs (\code{"RMSTD"}), the ratio between RMSTs (\code{"RMSTR"}), the HR
(\code{"HR"}), the median difference (\code{"median_diff"}), the difference
in time (\code{"percentile_diff"}) for reaching a survival percentile as
specified in (\code{percentile}), and the survival difference (\code{"survival_diff"})
at time specified in (\code{t}).
(\code{"HR"}).}

\item{percentile}{A scalar specifying the percentile at which to evaluate the
percentile difference.}

\item{t}{A scalar specifying the time at which to evaluate the survival difference}

\item{tau}{A scalar specifying the time horizon for evaluating RMSTs}

\item{plot_curves}{Boolean. Creates a plot if \code{TRUE}}
}
\value{
Returns the contrast between two fully specified survival curves.
Defaults to calculating all contrasts.
Possible contrasts are: \itemize{
\item Restricted mean survival time difference (RMSTD)
\item Restricted mean survival time ratio (RMSTR)
\item Hazard ratio (HR)
\item Median difference
\item Percentile difference at a certain percentile
\item Survival difference at time \eqn{t}}
}
\description{
Function for calculating contrasts between two fully specified survival
functions defined my scale and shape. Possible contrasts are the difference
and ratio in restricted mean survival times (RMSTD and RMSTR), the hazard
ratio (HR), the time difference at median survival, the time difference at
percentile survival, and the difference in survival at a specified time point
