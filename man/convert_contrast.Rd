\arguments{
\item{scale_trmt}{A scalar \eqn{>0} specifying the \dfn{scale parameter} in the treatment group.}

\item{scale_ctrl}{A scalar \eqn{>0} specifying the \dfn{scale parameter} in the treatment group.}

\item{parameterization}{One of: \itemize{
\item \code{parameterization = 1}: specifies Weibull distributed survival as \eqn{S(t) = 1- F(t) = \exp{(-(t/\mathrm{scale})^\mathrm{shape}))}},
\item \code{parameterization = 2}: specifies Weibull distributed survival as \eqn{S(t) = 1- F(t) = \exp{(-\mathrm{scale} * t^\mathrm{shape})}},
\item \code{parameterization = 3}: specifies Weibull distributed survival as \eqn{S(t) = 1- F(t) = \exp{(-(\mathrm{scale} * t)^\mathrm{shape})}}.}}

\item{HR}{A scalar specifying a hazard ratio. \code{HR} \eqn{< 1} suggests a lower hazard in the treatment group than in the control group.}

\item{median_diff}{A scalar specifying the difference in time \eqn{\Delta t} at which each group has survival \eqn{S(t) = 0.5}. \code{median_diff} \eqn{> 0} suggests superior survival in the treatment group.}

\item{percentile_diff}{A scalar specifying the difference in time \eqn{\Delta t} at which each group has the survival \eqn{S(t) =} \code{percentile}.}

\item{percentile}{A scalar specifying at which percentile of survival to evaluate \code{percentile_diff}.
\code{percentile_diff} is equal to \code{median_diff} when \code{percentile}  \eqn{=50}.}

\item{survival_diff}{A scalar specifying the survival difference in survival \eqn{\Delta S(t)} between treatment and control group.}

\item{RMSTD}{A scalar specifying the RMSTD between control group and treatment group. Allows for converting RMSTD to HR.}

\item{RMSTR}{A scalar specifying the RMSTR between control group and treatment group. Allows for converting RMSTD to HR.}

\item{tau}{A scalar specifying the time horizon \eqn{\tau} at which to evaluate RMST with \eqn{\mathrm{RMST} = \int_{0}^{\tau}S(t) \,dt}.}

\item{plot_curves}{Boolean. Creates a plot if \code{TRUE}}

\item{shape}{A scalar \eqn{>0} specifying the \dfn{shape parameter} in both groups. Shape
parameters in both groups are assumed to be equal.}

\item{t}{A scalar specifying the time \eqn{t} at which to evaluate \code{survival_diff}.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe containing the inputs, the difference (RMSTD) and ratio (RMSTR) in RMST,
the HR between treatment group and control group, the median survival time difference
An RMSTD \eqn{> 0} or an RMSTR \eqn{> 1} indicate a larger RMST in the treatment group,
a HR \eqn{< 1} indicates lower hazard in the treatment group.
}
\description{
Function for converting different contrasts into either the difference or the ratio of restricted mean survival times (RMSTs), the hazard ratio (HR),
and other contrasts.
}
\details{
Convertible contrasts are: \itemize{
\item hazard ratio (HR).
\item median difference: the difference in times \eqn{t} at which each survival curve passes \eqn{S(t) = 0.5 = 50 \%}.
\item percentile difference: the difference in times \eqn{t} at which each survival curve passes a certain \eqn{S(t)}. Simplifies to the median difference when the percentile \eqn{50} is chosen.
\item survival difference: difference between two survival curves \eqn{S(t)} at a specified time \eqn{t}.}
Survival is assumed to follow Weibull distributions in both control and treatment group with a constant HR,
implying the same shape parameter in treatment and control group.
